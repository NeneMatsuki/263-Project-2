The file "get_optimal_routes.py" returns the optimal solution from the generated routes using pulp library
The file "get_routes.py" generates all possible routes subject to constraints.
The file "utilities.py" stores the constraints for route generation

First run the get_routes file to obtain files that contain possible routes
***path ---> 263-PROJECT-2/get_routes.py***

Then run the get_optimal_routes.py" which returns the optimal route.
